The main.py file is the source code of my Databases project, where I designed a airline ticket booking system using Flask. <br />
Tables.sql file is my own code to create tables for the database. <br />
I also created user interfaces that is connected to my database for three types of users to manipulate: Customer, Agent and Airline Staff. <br />
In this system, you can search for flights, purchase tickets, view personal order statistics and so on...
